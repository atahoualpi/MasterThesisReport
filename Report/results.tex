\section{Results}

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Bugs}
\begin{itemize}
\item you have to press apply on prefabs
\item the procedure of putting the freq and ampl data in
\item it is object specific
\item lack of acoustical richness that might characterize synthetic signals \cite{giordano2006material}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Which Synthesis Method Is Better?}

\subsection{Why our work can be used in VR/AR?}

\subsection{Did we manage to achieve what we wanted?}

\subsection{How can we improve our work?}
\begin{itemize}
\item take into account the environment (reverberation etc)
\item make objects destructible
\end{itemize}
