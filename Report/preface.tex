\chapter*{Acknowledgements} 

We would like to express our gratitude and appreciation to our supervisor for his support and guidance throughout this thesis work.
Several discussion sessions and recommendations helped us to make the most out of this project and make it possible. 

We would like to express special thanks also to the rest of our classmates who did their thesis at the same time under the same supervisor and offered us their advice. Furthermore, we would like to thank JÃ¸rgen Rasmussen from the Acoustic Technology group at the Department of Electrical Engineering of DTU for giving us access to the anechoic chamber and providing the equipment to perform the necessary recordings. And last but not least to our family and friends whose support throughout this thesis was invaluable.
