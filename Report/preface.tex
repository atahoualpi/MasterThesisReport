\chapter*{Acknowledgements} 

We would like to express our gratitude and appreciation to our supervisor for his support and guidance throughout this thesis work.
Several discussion sessions and advice helped us take the most out of this project and make this study possible. 

We would like to express special thanks also to the rest of our classmates who did their thesis at the same time under the same supervisor and offered us their advice. Furthermore, we would like to thank the Acoustic Technology Department of DTU for providing us with the anechoic chamber and the equipment to perform recordings. And last but not least to our family and friends whose support throughout this thesis was invaluable.
