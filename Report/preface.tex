\chapter*{Acknowledgements} 
\mbox{}\par
We would like to express our gratitude and appreciation to our supervisor for his support and guidance throughout this thesis work.
Several discussion sessions and advice helped us take the most out of this project and make this study possible.

We would like to express special thanks also to the rest of our classmates who did their thesis at the same time under the same supervisor and offered us their advice. And last but not least to our family and friends whose support throughout this thesis was invaluable.
